Main Gameplay:
The user can create coins at the release of his mouse (LMB). He has his mouse at the top of the screen.In the beginning there is one miner rail/track where mine carts ocasionally come. The user tries to get as many of his coins in the mine cart as he can. The mine cart has a maxmimum capacity.

Between Gameplay:
At the end of the level (which is based on a short time limit), the user then can upgrade his equiptment using the amount of gold he collected. The upgrade costs increase every time the user buys it.
